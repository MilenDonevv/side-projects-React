/* 
Breakdown:
.tic-tac-toe-container::after:

This selects the pseudo-element ::after of the .tic-tac-toe-container class. 
Pseudo-elements like ::after allow you to insert content after the content of an element.

--------------------
content: "":

This property is required for pseudo-elements like ::after to be rendered. 
It inserts an empty string, effectively making the pseudo-element visible.

--------------------


clear: both:

This property is used to clear floating elements. clear: 
both means that no floating elements are allowed on either the left or the right side of the ::after pseudo-element. 
This forces the container to wrap around its floated children.


--------------------

display: table:

This property changes the display behavior of the ::after pseudo-element. 
display: table makes the ::after pseudo-element behave like a block-level table. 
This helps in making the container fully recognize the height of its floated children.

--------------------
Purpose:
When elements are floated within a container, the container might collapse and not expand to cover the floated elements. 
By using this clearfix technique, you ensure that the container 
(.tic-tac-toe-container in this case) correctly encloses its floated child elements, thus maintaining the desired layout.
